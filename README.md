# Predict-sepssis-during-ICU-stay-using-different-ML-Classification-methods

# Overview

* Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are continually faced with the difficulty of monitoring patients for the development of sepsis (an infection that can accrue while staying in ICU).

* While this challenge is not new and have been around for few years, the recent COVID- 19 pandemic has significantly increase its prominence. 

***Therefore, for an ICU, the ability to predict whether a patient stay in ICU will develop a sepssis or not during their stay in the ICU, is extremely beneficial.*** 

* This is the motivation for developing the machine learning model. There are two main purposes: 

1. Reducing the risk of health complications.
2. Manage the ICU resources (such as bed availability, etc.).

* The training dataset provides list of essential attributes (features) related to: patient characteristics, diagnoses, treatments, services, hospital charges and patients socio-economic background.

***"The main goal is “Predict if a given in ICU would not develop a sepsis (Sepsis Negative / class 0) or will develop sepsis (Sepsis Positive / class 1) during their ICU stay”.***
